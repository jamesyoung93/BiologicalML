Biological Machine Learning  

There are 3 biological machine learning projects in this directory. 
1. Predicting gestational age and pre-term birth using RNAseq data. This was part of a "DREAM" challenge hosted by Synapse. I worked on this group with fellow grad students in the biology department over the summer. The group write up can be viewed here https://github.com/jamesyoung93/Preterm-Dream-Challenge. I have also included my personal contributions in the files above.

2. Drug Repurposing Success Prediciton. Using xgboost and available data 

3. Protein Translational Efficiency
